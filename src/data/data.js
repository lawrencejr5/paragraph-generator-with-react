  `   The world as we know is indeed a global village in the sense that people 
    can now connect even though they are not close enough. They can also, 
    share experiences and access the same information through technologies 
    such as social media. Social media platforms have proven to be a very 
    essential factor in reshaping this global village thereby empowering youths, 
    women, governments and entrepreneurs while mostly encouraging freedom of speech 
    in our part of the world.`,
  `   In the 21st century, almost everyone knows about social media and is on at 
    least one social media platform or another, for example, Facebook, Instagram, 
    Twitter, Snapchat, and the rest of them.  Therefore, social media has become 
    very popular and has become one of the best platforms to stay connected with 
    people far and wide. As of 2021, over 4.26 billion people were using social 
    media worldwide and this number has been projected to increase to almost 6 
    billion in 2027 (Dixon Statista, 2023). On average, internet users spend almost 
    150 minutes on social media and messaging applications with an increase of 
    more than half an hour since 2015`,
  `   Social media has impacts on many areas like communication, education,
    marketing, politics, relationships, and so on. In areas such as politics, 
    social media plays a major role by enabling democracy to be shared 
    internationally and also enabling citizens to express their opinions to 
    the government, and the government to get feedbacks from their citizens 
    (Dareen A. Mishaal1, Emad Abu-Shanab2, 2015). Social media has also made 
    corruption in politics less private and susceptive to the public perception. 
    Before social media, people had to buy newspapers to know what is going on 
    within their country or in the world, but now, all you need is just a few 
    clicks and you are already updated on the latest news.`,
  `   There is no doubt that social media has become popular mostly among students. 
    There are very few students presently who do not use social media. Social media 
    impacts the lives of students in many ways as it allows students to create online 
    identities, communicate, connect with like minds, and express themselves easily. 
    Students use social media in different ways depending on their interests or friends, 
    like sharing funny moments via a meme or video, communicating and connecting with 
    family and friends, following popular celebrities, updating themselves on the 
    latest trends, and a lot more other ways.`,
  `   The localization of social media is not something that is not very common, 
    i.e. a social media for just a particular area or people. There are a lot of 
    social media platforms that connect people globally and has made communication 
    in the world a lot easier. However, connecting globally lets us understand 
    different cultural diversities around the world but but excludes our primary 
    local cultures, be it our hometown or school or our area of residence. A local 
    social media would help to circulate local contents especially about a particular 
    area or people thereby promoting the culture of that area/people. This is the goal 
    of this study. This study focuses on the development of a web based social media 
    platform for Godfrey Okoye Students.`,
  `   Just like every other area, universities and their host communities 
    have their own cultures, values and norms. This study presents 
    GOBOOK: a social media platform for Godfrey Okoye University, Enugu, Nigeria.`,
  `   In as much as there is a wide variety of social media platforms that students 
    use, we hardly see the local ones, the local ones that are focused only about a 
    particular area or concerned about the culture of an area. Take Godfrey Okoye 
    university for example, students use social media platforms like WhatsApp, 
    Facebook, Twitter, and others. These social media platforms are quite reliable 
    in terms of communication, and information sharing and also allows students 
    experience different cultural diversities worldwide.  but due to the large scope 
    of people these social media platforms are covering, it makes it harder for people 
    to fully feel the cultural life within their locality, for example, their university.`,
  `The scope of this study is centered on developing a web-based application for 
    student online communication and information sharing within the University. 
    The system is strictly based on connecting students within Godfrey Okoye University.`,
  `The research is aimed at developing a local social media platform, 
    especially for Godfrey Okoye University. The objectives include:
    To design a very simple user interface that would be user friendly and responsive on all screen sizes.
    To create a database that would be able to contain some certain information on student users.
    To use JavaScript to compress images to increase the load time speed.
    To develop an advertising environment for students on campus.`,
